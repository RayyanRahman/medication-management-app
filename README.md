Users can mark medications as "taken"  and view upcoming medications for the next day.

    Set reminders for daily, weekly, or monthly medication intakes.
    User can Mark medications as "taken" for present day and user won't be allowed to mark upcoming medications for next day.
    View a list of medications scheduled for the current and next day.
    Automatic date tracking to provide relevant reminders.

Technologies Used:

    Frontend: React.js for building the user interface.
    State Management: useState and useEffect hooks for managing state and side effects.

    CSS: Custom-styled components for a visually appealing and responsive design.
